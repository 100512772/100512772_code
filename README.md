This code has been developed and testing using PyCharm Community Edition 2021.3.1
Python Version 3.10

Both programs should be run using PyCharm in order for them to work together.

Instructions: 
- Run 'server' first 
- Then run 'client' after
- The two will connect together
- Look on each server and client output screen for instructions and data being sent between the two
- Must have image_data.txt within the same folder as the python files for this to work
- IF # if OSError: [WinError 10048] Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted occurs then change Port number to 1234 or something else but the port numbers must be the same on client and server
